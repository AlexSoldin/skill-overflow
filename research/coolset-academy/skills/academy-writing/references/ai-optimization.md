# AI search optimization rules

These rules make Coolset Academy content discoverable and re-usable by large language models (ChatGPT, Claude) in addition to human readers. Apply to all Academy blogs and reports.

## H2 headings as user questions

Rewrite all H2s to sound like real user questions – things the target persona might ask in natural language.

**Before:** "CSRD reporting requirements"
**After:** "What are the reporting requirements under CSRD?"

**Before:** "Scope 3 emissions explained"
**After:** "What are Scope 3 emissions and why do they matter?"

The questions should match how a sustainability manager, compliance officer or CFO would phrase a query to an AI assistant or search engine.

## Answer-first section structure

Begin every section with a short, factual answer. Do not warm up, do not write broad introductions, do not use fluff language. The first 1–2 sentences should directly answer the H2 question.

**Before:** "When it comes to understanding the complexities of double materiality, there are several important considerations that businesses should keep in mind."

**After:** "Double materiality requires companies to assess both how sustainability issues affect their business (financial materiality) and how their business affects people and the environment (impact materiality)."

## Pronoun avoidance for key terms

Avoid pronouns when referring to key regulatory terms, frameworks or organizations. Repeat specific names instead of using "it," "they," "this" or "the regulation." Keep it natural – do not over-repeat within the same sentence.

**Before:** "It requires companies to report on their environmental impact."
**After:** "The CSRD requires companies to report on their environmental impact."

**Before:** "They must submit reports by 2026."
**After:** "Companies falling under the second wave of CSRD must submit reports by 2026."

## Structured formats for processes and comparisons

Use bullet points, numbered lists or step-by-step formats to explain:
- Processes (how to conduct a double materiality assessment)
- Comparisons (CSRD vs. NFRD, Scope 1 vs. Scope 2 vs. Scope 3)
- Decision logic (does CSRD apply to your company?)
- Requirements lists (what data points ESRS requires)
- Timelines (phase-in dates for different company categories)

## Proprietary and original information

Include Coolset-specific content when possible:
- Company frameworks and methodologies
- Product capabilities and how they help with the topic
- Insights from working with clients
- Practical tips based on real implementation experience

This type of content is highly valued by LLMs because it cannot be found elsewhere. Frame it naturally within the article – never as a sales pitch.

## Anchor concepts in specific examples

Replace theoretical language with practical examples. Show how something works in practice rather than explaining it abstractly.

**Before:** "Companies must consider their value chain impacts."
**After:** "A clothing brand, for example, must assess emissions from cotton farming, textile manufacturing, shipping and retail – not just its own office energy use."

## FAQ section requirements

Every Academy blog and report must end with a FAQ section. Create 3–5 FAQs based on the most common queries related to the topic. Answer each query in under 60 words. Use natural question phrasing.

The FAQ section serves dual purpose: it provides quick answers for human readers scanning the article, and it gives LLMs cleanly structured Q&A pairs that are easy to extract and cite.
