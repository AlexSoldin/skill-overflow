# Coolset style guide

## Language and tone

Use a smart, conversational and professional tone. Be approachable and authoritative without sounding academic or promotional. Write clearly and concisely. Avoid fluff and get to the point.

## Voice rules

- Use active voice at all times. Replace passive constructions with active phrasing.
- Use third person in general explanations (legal requirements, methodology).
- Use second person when giving instructions, guidance or checklists.
- Keep sentences short and readable.
- Keep paragraphs to 2–3 sentences. Use line breaks to support scannability.
- Use American English spelling.
- Sentence case only. Only capitalize the first word of a sentence, names and proper nouns.
- No Oxford comma unless necessary for clarity.
- Use hyphens (–) instead of commas for short subordinate clauses. Never use the em-dash "—".
- Spell out acronyms on first mention: Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). Then use acronyms.
- Use statistics when possible. Always verify through web research and cite the source directly in text. If you cannot cite a source, leave the statistic out.
- Use hands-on and actionable language that helps readers visualize what needs to be done.
- Use direct address where it improves clarity ("your company," "businesses need to…") but avoid overusing "you" in formal explanations.

## What to avoid

- First person ("I," "we," "you" in personal voice) unless quoting Coolset directly (e.g., "At Coolset, we recommend…").
- Passive phrasing like "it is believed that" or "there are some who say." Be direct and confident.
- Filler phrases: "let's explore," "as mentioned earlier," "this article will…," "in conclusion," "thus," "moreover."
- Over-the-top language: "groundbreaking," "revolutionary," "changing everything" – unless there is hard evidence.
- Jargon without explanation. Prefer clear, everyday language over abstract or ornate terms. Avoid words like "tenacious," "withering," "therefore."
- Excessive capitalization.
- Bold text within paragraphs.
- Sarcasm entirely.
- Forced metaphors or alliteration. Only use sparingly when it helps explain complex ideas.
- Clever-for-cleverness'-sake headlines. Headlines and subheadings should be descriptive and informative.
- Repeating definitions or summaries already explained earlier in the piece.
- Editorializing or speculating. Avoid opinions not backed by regulation, policy guidance or cited sources.
- Overselling Coolset. The goal is to inform and guide to build credibility, not pitch.

## What to include

- Occasional dry, on-topic humor when appropriate.
- Real-world examples to ground abstract concepts (e.g., value chain due diligence for a clothing brand).
- Internal links to relevant Coolset articles (search: "site:coolset.com [topic]").
- Regulatory timelines and consequences when relevant.
- Clear next steps or takeaways in closing.
- Authoritative and recent sources (EU Commission, Eurostat, EEA).
