## Blog introduction example

"Deciphering ESG is like trying to get the right frequency on a vintage radio, it's all about finding clarity in a sea of static.

With the European Union pushing sustainability standards at record speeds and companies scrambling to present themselves as the green organizations everyone wants them to be, it's easy to lose sight of where to start.

Understanding how Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) metrics fit into all of this can be a daunting task, even for the most seasoned specialists. Fear not - this guide helps you get started."

## Sub-heading and body text example

**What you need to know to start reporting on CSRD from 2025 onwards**

Starting January 1, 2025, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) will expand its scope, becoming mandatory for around 39,000 additional companies across Europe. While the Omnibus Proposal will likely change the scope of companies falling under CSRD's scope, businesses should still assume that they are in-scope until the EU makes definitive conclusions.

**What makes this work:**
- H2 reads like a real question someone would ask
- Opens with a direct, factual answer (date + number)
- Uses specific names (CSRD, Omnibus Proposal) instead of pronouns
- Short, scannable paragraph

## Section with bullet points example

**The bigger picture: What this means for businesses**

The Omnibus proposal is a drastic deregulation effort that undermines years of progress on corporate sustainability and due diligence. While proponents argue that reducing reporting obligations will alleviate burdens on businesses, the reality is stark:

- Companies that have already invested heavily in compliance are now at a competitive disadvantage. The EU hereby punishes early adopters.
- Trust in EU institutions will be at an all time low as the Omnibus sets a dangerous precedent: EU law can be reverted at any moment.
- Investors with €6.6 trillion in assets under management have warned that going through with the Omnibus could undermine the integrity and ambition of the EU's sustainable finance framework.
- Over 200 investors and financial actors argue that these regulations are essential for long-term economic growth and ensuring capital flows align with the European Green Deal.

To put costs into perspective: SOMO estimates that the estimated annual cost of complying with CSDDD is just 0.13% of the average shareholder payout in 2023 – hardly an unbearable burden.

**What makes this work:**
- Strong, direct opening sentence with a clear position
- Bullet points for a list of distinct consequences
- Each bullet is a complete thought (1–2 sentences)
- Closes with a specific, sourced statistic that adds perspective
- Dry humor in the final line ("hardly an unbearable burden")
