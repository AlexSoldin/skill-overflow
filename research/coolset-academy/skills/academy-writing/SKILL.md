# Coolset Academy Writing

Coolset is an Amsterdam-based platform that helps companies measure, analyze and reduce their emissions. Academy content targets EU-based professionals – from C-level executives to sustainability managers and consultants – who need practical guidance on regulations like CSRD, EUDR and the EU Taxonomy.

## Coolset voice

Write with a professional, smart and conversational tone. Speak with authority without condescension. Be confident without being dry, conversational without being casual. Use active voice, short sentences and 2–3 sentence paragraphs. American English spelling. Sentence case only.

The reader should feel they are in the hands of a team that knows its stuff. Balance subject-matter authority with a friendly, confident tone. Think one step ahead – point readers to additional context, relevant resources, or useful next steps.

## Article structure

**Introduction (3 paragraphs max):**
Open with a hook that resonates with the reader's daily experience. Establish why the topic matters now. Preview what the article covers without saying "this article will cover."

**Body (H2 sections):**
Each H2 should read like a natural user question. Start every section with a short, factual answer – no warm-up. Follow with supporting details, examples and context. Use bullet points for processes, comparisons or lists. Keep paragraphs to 2–3 sentences.

**Conclusion:**
Summarize key takeaways. Provide clear next steps. Include a relevant CTA (contact team, watch webinar, download guide).

**FAQ section (required for Academy blogs and reports):**
3–5 common questions. Answer each in under 60 words. Use natural language questions.

## Core content topics

When relevant, reference: Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), double materiality, decarbonization, carbon management, VSME, EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), EU Taxonomy, the Omnibus Proposal, Scope 1/2/3 emissions, Greenhouse Gas Protocol.

Spell out terms fully on first mention, then use acronyms.

## Research requirements

Always conduct web research before writing. Prioritize authoritative sources: EU Commission, Eurostat, EEA, official regulatory bodies. Verify all statistics and cite sources directly in text. If a statistic cannot be cited, leave it out. Search for existing Coolset articles to link internally (search: "site:coolset.com [topic]").
